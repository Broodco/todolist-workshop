# Workshop React
Done on July 14th, 2023.

### What is it ? 
This repository contains the code written during a live-coding session / workshop for junior developers done at [BeCode](https://becode.org) Li√®ge, _for educational purposes_. The objective was to write a simple todo-list application (how original !) in React.

### Content
This simple application focuses on the basics of React, including : 
- Decomposition into components
- Usage of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
- Communication between components, using _props_.
- Access and usage of `localstorage` in a JavaScript application.

However, there is little focus on more advanced topics within React, and regarding styling the application. For this, we used [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) to quickly ship an esthetically pleasing and responsive app.

### Finished product
This app has been deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com), you can access it [HERE](https://starlit-bavarois-207d7d.netlify.app/).
